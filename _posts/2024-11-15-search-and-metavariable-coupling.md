#### [Leni Aniva](https://leni.sh) is a PhD student advised by Clark Barrett in the Stanford Center for Automated Reasoning ([Centaur](https://centaur.stanford.edu/)) Lab. Her PhD work is focused on applying a combination of machine learning and formal methods to the problem of mathematical theorem proving. She is the author of [PyPantograph](https://github.com/lenianiva/PyPantograph) which is a tool for training machine learning models for Lean 4.
